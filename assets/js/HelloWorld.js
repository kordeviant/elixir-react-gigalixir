          <p styleName="red">Long story short: I went to SAMPAD(NODET) school and studied architecture at Tehran university and got a masters degree in construction management, but it is never late for anything. i was top of my class in computer and mathematics, and after improving my language skills, i realized not only my path is computer and IT, but i am good at it (having learned OOP at young age). i have been pursuing front end development as a career ever since, but i always dreamed of starting my own business and studied all about back-end development, design patterns, event driven architecture, CQRS, Docker and Kubernetes. i have a setup of Rancher, Gitlab and Kafka on my home server. i am proficient with functional programming style and i am an expert in RxJS, soon i realized i can program c# too and use my Rx skills there too. i use JS and TS everyday, modify c# and JS back-ends when i need too, and i have studied Elixir for the past year.</p>
